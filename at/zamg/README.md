# ZAMG Datasets

To track changes in temperature, snowfall and more, we use historic data provided by ZAMG [on their data hub](https://data.hub.zamg.ac.at).
For more information on their API, [see their documentation](https://dataset.api.hub.zamg.ac.at/v1/docs/).

Our datasets are automatically updated every morning between 7am and 9am.

## Stations
For our visualisations, we only work with a subset of ZAMG weather stations, which have
- recorded data since at least 1961
- no major reporting gaps in that time period
