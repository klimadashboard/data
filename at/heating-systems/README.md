# Heating Systems
Based on [census data from Statistik Austria](https://statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/energie_umwelt_innovation_mobilitaet/energie_und_umwelt/energie/energieeinsatz_der_haushalte/index.html), we have assembled the following files for a quick overview of heating systems in use, by federal states and year.

The .csv file contains the heating system data for households in Austria and its 9 federal states since 2004, provided by Statistik Austria. The basis of the data is a questionnaire which is sent every 2 years to 8500 households, which is then extrapolated. The energy sources are oil, gas, coal, heat pumps or solar, electric heater, wood or pellet and district heat. The data for the energy sources coal, gas, oil, wood are presented in single heating systems, central heating systems and their sum. 
Statistik Austria states that there is a bigger uncertainty for the coal heating systems and that the raw data for �unsure energy source� and �central heating system� was attributed to district heating.
